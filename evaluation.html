This is the evaluation checklist. Some of the tools and equipment I didn't have access to. However, this list really doesn't do justice to show the myriad of lessons learned and experience gained from Fab Academy!

<hr>
    
PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES, PROJECT MANAGEMENT <a href="week1.html">[link]</a><br>
✓ HTML page(s) that documents a student’s work.<br>
✓ Student has made commits in the Academy archive.<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  </p>

<br><br>

COMPUTER­AIDED DESIGN <a href="week2.html">[link]</a><br>
? Original 2D design files<br>
✓ Original 3D design files<br>
✓ A description of the software experimentation process.<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  For 2D design file skill usage, see <a href="week3.html">week 3</a>. - Is this OK?</p>

<br><br>

COMPUTER­CONTROLLED CUTTING <a href="week3.html">[link]</a><br>
✓ Description of process<br>
? Images of the student using both the laser and vinyl cutter<br>
✓ How to make your press fit construction kit<br>
✓ The original design files.<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  Did not have access to a vinyl cutter. Had friends help out with laser cutting, but didn't do it myself for the press-fit construction kit. Did use laser cutter myself for Headband v0.2 for cutting thin HDPE.</p>

<br><br>

ELECTRONICS PRODUCTION (WEEK 1 OF 2) <a href="week4.html">[link]</a><br>
❏ Make a FabISP<br>
❏ Description of the process<br>
❏ Photos of the process<br>
- Design files (only if you created a new design).<br>
<br>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Outliers: I​f board is not working, multiple efforts and troubleshooting steps taken, shown and documented.

<p>Notes:<br>
  Friends at Othermachine milled a FabISP on the Othermill. Need the components to stuff the board though.</p>

<br><br>

COMPUTER­CONTROLLED MACHINING <a href="week5.html">[link]</a><br>
❏ Original design files of student’s own design<br>
❏ Must machine “something big”, files must be cut.<br>
❏ Molds too large for the Modela are all acceptable. <br>
❏ Design files<br>
❏ Tooling, feeds & speeds and materials used. <br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  Possible! Used a large format Shopbot for milling the composite molds. Now have access to a Shopbot Desktop. Can create 'something big', but it will need multiple sheets.</p>

<br><br>

ELECTRONICS DESIGN (WEEK 2 OF 2) <a href="week6.html">[link]</a><br>
❏ Redraw the echo hello­world board or design your own.<br>
❏ Add (at minimum) a button and LED with current­limiting resistor.<br>
❏ Description and pictures of process<br>
❏ The original design files (Eagle, KiCad, Inkscape ­ whatever)<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  Might be possible if I design board for a large bit, and mill it on the Shopbot. Would still need to order the components though.</p>

<br><br>

EMBEDDED PROGRAMING <a href="week7.html">[link]</a><br>
❏ Document what you learned from reading a microcontroller datasheet.<br>
❏ What questions do you have? (optional)<br>
❏ What would you like to learn more about (optional)<br>
❏ Description of programming process<br>
❏ Program board in as many programming languages as possible (at least one)<br>
❏ Your code must be documented (code must be executable, no screenshots!) <br>
❏ At bare minimum, the example code must be modified<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  Need to make the board. Some of it is possible without the board.</p>

<br><br>

3D MOLDING AND CASTING <a href="week8.html">[link]</a><br>
❏ 3D mold designed, CAD files provided<br>
❏ Mold machined<br>
❏ Parts cast<br>
❏ Machinable wax is recommended, not required<br>
❏ Foam is also acceptable<br>
❏ Document process, tooling, materials, machine and feeds & speeds used (if feeds &
speeds applicable)<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  Need the casting materials and machinable wax. Can the mold be 3D printed for this?</p>

<br><br>

3D SCANNING AND PRINTING <a href="week9.html">[link]</a><br>
? 3D scan an object<br>
✓ Design and print a 3D print a model<br>
✓ File sharing site downloads are not acceptable<br>
✓ Provide your design files<br>
✓ Document the process<br>
✓ tools and materials used<br>
✓ troubleshooting tips<br>
- Repair and print the scan (encouraged, but not required)<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  For the 3D scan instead of actually scanning something, I tried to re-create an object provided similar scan data. Is this OK?</p>

<br><br>

INPUT DEVICES <a href="week10.html">[link]</a><br>
At Minimum (electronics beginners):<br>
❏ Fabricate the “hello world” input example boards<br>
❏ Program them in as many languages as possible<br>
❏ Understand why the “hello world” board needs the included components<br>
❏ Grasp the “typical application”<br>
❏ Make as many sensor boards as possible and thoroughly understand how they work. <br>
❏ Document each sensor, what it does, what you learned.<br>
<br>
Students with Previous Electronics Experience<br>
❏ Above requirements, plus<br>
❏ Design your own sensor boards<br>
❏ Provide the design files<br>
❏ Use new and unfamiliar sensors<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  </p>

<br><br>

OUTPUT DEVICES <a href="week11.html">[link]</a><br>
At Minimum (electronics beginners):<br>
❏ Fabricate the “hello world” input example board(s)<br>
❏ Program them in as many languages as possible<br>
❏ Make as many output boards as possible and thoroughly understand how they work. <br>
❏ Document:<br>
❏ each board created/device used<br>
❏ what it does<br>

Students with Previous Electronics Experience<br>
❏ Above requirements, plus....<br>
❏ Design your own output board(s)<br>
❏ Provide the design files<br>

✓ Mold machined<br>
❏ Composite part(s) cast<br>
❏ Document process, tooling, materials, machine and feeds & speeds used (if feeds & speeds applicable)<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  Remainder of work to be done is: coating the molds with a sealant, cutting the material pieces, casting it, removing it from mold, and finally strength testing</p>

<br><br>

EMBEDDED NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS <a href="week13.html">[link]</a><br>
At Minimum (electronics beginners):<br>
❏ Fabricate the “hello world” networking example board(s) <br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  The assignment from the <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/index.html">schedule</a> is "design and build a wired &/or wireless network connecting at least two processors". The networking in my final project could work here, but there were no boards fabricated for filling out this checklist. There is also no error detection in the final project's networking (yet) - this can be fixed. Networking is a fun week.</p>

<br><br>

  </p>

<br><br>

DIGITAL FABRICATION APPLICATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS <a href="week17.html">[link]</a><br>
P​ropose a final project that integrates the range of units covered. <br>

✓ how much will it cost?<br>
✓ what parts and systems will be made?<br>
✓ what processes will be used?<br>
✓ what tasks need to be completed?<br>
✓ what questions need to be answered?<br>
✓ what is the schedule?<br>
✓ how will it be evaluated?<br>
✓ projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery of all of the
skills<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
  These questions really helped to narrow down and focus the project.</p>

<br><br>

DIGITAL FABRICATION PROJECT DEVELOPMENT <a href="update11.html">[link]</a>br>
